# rfusiontables
R package to access fusion tables via oauth2 and the v2 fusion tables api

Basically I wanted to have a way to access some sort of cloud like datastore
for my R projects, and fusion tables are a great way to do it in my mind.

They are queriable, fast and can handle quite a bit of data, and there is an
easy to use API.

I owe the framework of this to Andrei Lopatenko, who created an earlier
gfusiontables package, though now based on a deprecated authentication scheme.
